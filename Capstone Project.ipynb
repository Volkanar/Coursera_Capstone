Tourism is an important activity for economy of countries and people usually like to visit developed countries. It is easy to explore and analyze cities with location data. Tourists like to visit different places and analysis of two cities will help them to make their choices easier and more efficient."

This will help to understand their similarity and dissimilarity."
